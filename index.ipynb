    "\n",
    "Think about the importance of being able to save data files to CSV, or another format. For example, you start with a raw dataset which you may have downloaded from the web. Then you painstakingly take hours preprocessing the data, cleaning it, constructing features, aggregates, and other views. In order to avoid having to rerun your entire process, you are apt to save the current final cleaned version of the dataset into a serialized format like CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pickle` allows you to go beyond just storing data in a format like CSV, and save any object that is currently loaded into your Python interpreter. Literally anything. You could save data stored in a `dict`, `list`, or `set` as a pickle file. You can also save functions or class instances as pickle files. Saving models is one of the important use cases of this technique."
